<p>Families who share everyday activities together form strong emotional ties. Studies have found that families who enjoy group activities together share a stronger emotional bond as well as an ability to adapt well to situations as a family. 




In positive side, I think this lockdown is a great way to bond with my family. It's make our family share every favourite activities together. I hope my family will stay doing all the activities during this lockdown together and stay being close to each other even after lockdown and forever. I love my family :)
